# Mall-Customer-Segmentation-Using-K-means
Creating a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.

 The project involves:

- **Data Collection**: Gathering a dataset of customer information, including features like age, annual income, and spending score.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data by handling missing values, normalizing features, and selecting relevant attributes for clustering.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying key features that influence customer behavior, such as age, income, and spending score, to use in the clustering process.
- **Model Training**: Applying the K-means algorithm to the selected features, determining the optimal number of clusters using methods like the Elbow method or Silhouette analysis.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the quality of the clusters using metrics like silhouette score and visualizing the clusters to interpret the results.
- **Segmentation Analysis**: Analyzing the characteristics of each customer segment to gain insights into their behavior and preferences.
- **Deployment**: Implementing the clustering model in a real-time application to segment new customers based on their purchasing behavior.

This project leverages K-means clustering to create meaningful customer segments, enabling targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.
